                Dot-voting is a quick and simple method for prioritizing a long list of options.
            </p>
            <p>
                Itâ€™s less cognitively demanding than having to perform full ranking of all the options, because participants are not required to give a comparative judgment of each option, and it allows participants to express a preference for more than one option at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also creates a sense of engagement and allows participants to see the decision process in action and understand how the final choice was made.
