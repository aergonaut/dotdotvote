= Dot dot Vote!

This is a simple web application for
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting[Dot-voting].

The goal is to create a _simple_ and anonymous dot-voting system which allows
people to create quick polls to run with their teams.



== Hacking

Since this is a Rust project, Rust and Cargo are both required in order to
build and test.

* `RUST_LOG=info cargo run` will build and run the application locally. After
  which link:http://localhost:8000/[localhost:8000] will have the application
  up and running.
* `cargo test` will run the tests, of which there are very few at the moment!

The application is built with link:https://github.com/http-rs/tide[Tide] for
the web tier and link:https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx[sqlx] for the
database tier.

The views are all very simple HTML and a little bit of JavaScript written with
link:https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust[Handlebars]

In order to experiment with the API, execute `cargo run` and then access
